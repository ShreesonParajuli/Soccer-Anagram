# Soccer-Anagram
The Soccer Anagram Game is a fun and interactive web-based game where users guess the names of soccer players from scrambled letters. The goal is to help users test their soccer knowledge to see if they know them or not. You will get hints everytime you get wrong per person and there is a 30 second timer to make pressure for you if you don't know them.
